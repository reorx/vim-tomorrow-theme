Tomorrow Theme plugin for vim, forked from @chriskempson's [work](https://github.com/chriskempson/vim-tomorrow-theme)

Notes:

- Tomorrow Theme is not compatible with [base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base1://github.com/chriskempson/base16),
  which I don't intent to fix in this repo.

- Since I use Tomorrow-Night-Bright mainly, most changes will affect on that `.vim` file only.
