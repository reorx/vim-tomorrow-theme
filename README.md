Tomorrow Theme plugin for vim, forked from @chriskempson's [work](https://github.com/chriskempson/vim-tomorrow-theme)

Motivation:

- The aim of this fork is to replenish lost and adjust existing colors to fit my personal appreciation.

- Since I use Tomorrow-Night-Bright mainly, most changes will affect on that `.vim` file only.

- Tomorrow Theme is not compatible with [base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base1://github.com/chriskempson/base16)
  in iTerm2 with both base16-iterm2 and base16-shell, which I don't intent to fix in this repo.
